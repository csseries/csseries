#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Claire-Sophie, I am based in Dubai and here are a few things I am currently working on:
- :fire: cookit is a deep learning model for object detection. The user can upload a picture and find recipes which make the most of available ingredients at home.
- :sunny: ds_in_dubai is a field study about the data science job opportunities in the UAE

I am also an entrepreneur and working on some nice business ideas :briefcase: ... more to come!
